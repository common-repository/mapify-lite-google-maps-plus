Add incredibly powerful Google Maps with Mapify Lite: Custom image mode, tooltips, per-location photo/video galleries, & more!

== Description ==
Mapify Lite is not only the easiest way to add enhanced Google Maps to your site, but enhances your map with custom pin-point graphics, limitless locations, tooltips on each location, and pop-up galleries with video and photos. It also allows the use of ANY custom map image of your choosing (png and jpeg supported), all while keeping the great zoom and pan effect of Google maps! 

**Mapify Lite Demo:** Note: Both variations are included: You get image mode AND Google Maps mode with the plugin. [See the demos and full details here](https://mapifypro.com/product/mapifylite/)**Key Features of Mapify Lite** *	**The easiest way to add Google Maps to WordPress!**Though Mapify Lite is the easiest way to add Google Maps to WordPress, it also unlocks your creativity with crucial mapping features. Create a map, add locations, place the short code. Boom, done.*	**Use any image for your map**Google maps is great, but severely limits how you can display a map on your site. Mapify Lite breaks those barriers and allows you to use a map of your choosing, but maintains the ability to zoom, pan, and add locations. Mapify Lite supports Jpegs, gifs, and PNG files, and even lets you specify the background color if using transparent images. *	**Tell Your Story On The Map!**With Mapify Lite, your map is only limited by your imagination, not Google's restrictive rules on style. You don’t even have to use a map, and can add detailed info to any photo, artwork, or image of your choosing (think "Hotspots “)*	**Google Map Integration**Unlock Google Maps with our powerful features. Look, we like Google Maps too, but thought it could use some tweaks. Want to stick with Google maps but need more control? Mapify Lite fully supports Google maps and address-specific pinpoints.

Mapify Lite allows you to add endless locations to your map. Better yet, it allows you to control what appears when a user hovers over the pinpoints. Photos, videos, and information displayed is under your control. Just click around on the map found on the demo for a preview, it's all running on Mapify Lite!*	**A Powerful & Intuitive Admin**The Mapify Lite plugin seamlessly integrates with the Wordpress Admin, allowing you to customize your map and locations with a simple, intuitive interface. Enter new locations by double clicking on the map, or by entering the exact address.Add customized pinpoint graphics to your map, custom tooltip content for each location, control the default zoom levels to focus on specific regions (Google Maps Mode), and more!*	**jQuery Effects**Stand out from the crowd with ultra-slick, app-like effects in the form of custom pop-ups, momentum-based drag and drop action, and pan and zoom behavior of your map, regardless of the image*	**Amazing Image Mode Features**

Perfect for gamers using in-game map, park maps, and other non-google maps.*	**Toggle zoom functionality**Perfect for those that prefer to "lock" their map in place, whether on Google Maps or Image Mode*	**Set Default Zoom Level**Set your default zoom level in Google Maps Mode to showcase entire countries, or a specific neighborhood.*	**Extensive [Documentation and tutorials here](https://mapifypro.com/mapifylite-tutorials/).***	**[Seamlessly Upgrade to MapifyPro](https://mapifypro.com) for business-ready power features.
